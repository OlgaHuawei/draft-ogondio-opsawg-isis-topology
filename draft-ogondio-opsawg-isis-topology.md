--- abstract

This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstracted view of a network topology that contains Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS). This document augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding IS-IS concepts and explains how the data model can be used to represent the IS-IS topology.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

# Introduction

Network operators perform the capacity planning for their networks and run regular what-if scenarios analisys based on representations of the real network. Those what-if analysis and capacity planning processes require, among other information, a topological view (domains, nodes, links, network interconnection) of the deployed network. Such topological view requires on the one hand enough detail to carry out the required analysis but on the other hand abstracted enough to make those analysis viable.

This draft address the use case of modeling the topology of IP/MPLS networks that run IS-IS as IGP protocol. The draft builds on the ietf-network model in {{!RFC8345}}, enhanced in {{!RFC8346}} and {{!RFC8944}} which extend the generic network and network topology data models with topology attributes specific to Layer 3 and Layer 2. However, there is not any model that exposes Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) specific network information. This information is required in the IP/MPLS planning process to properly assess the required network resources to meet the traffic demands in normal and failure scenarios.

This document defines a YANG data model for representing the IS-IS topology. The data model augments ietf-network module {{!RFC8345}} by adding the IS-IS information. The proposed YANG data model is used to export the topology of an IP/MPLS network from a network controller to an Operation Support System (OSS) tools with the aim of performing network planning and visualization.

This document explains the scope and purpose of the IS-IS topology model and how the topology and service models fit together.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture {{!RFC8342}}.

## Terminology and Notations

This document assumes that the reader is familiar with IS-IS and the contents of {{!RFC8345}}. The document uses terms from those documents.

The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in {{!RFC7950}}, {{!RFC8795}} and {{!RFC8346}}.

## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in  {{!RFC2119}}, {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Tree Diagram

Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in {{ietf-l3-isis-topology-tree}} of this document.
The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is defined in {{!RFC8340}}.

## Prefix in Data Node Names

  In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

| Prefix | Yang Module            | Reference    |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |

# Use of IETF-Topology for Representing an IP/MPLS network domain

IP/MPLS Networks can contain multiple domain IGP domains. We can define an IGP domain as the collection of nodes and links that participate in the same IGP process. The topology information of a domain can be structured according to ietf-topology information model
For example, if BGP-LS is used to collect the information, the nodes and links that are announced with the same combination of AS number / are considered to belong to the same domain. 

If a node and/or layer termination point  participates in more than one IGP it will be present in multiple IGP domain networks.

The ietf-network instance MUST include the following properties to indicate it is a domain running an IGP instance:

A network-id that uniquely identifies such domain in the network.
The "network-types property should include the l3t:l3-unicast-topology, to indicate it is a network in which the nodes are capable of forwarding unicast packet. Also, this draft proposed to ade a new property, isis-topology, to indicate the topology being represented is running an IGP process. 

Also, should the topology include information such as bandwidth, delay information or color, it must include tet:te-topology.
To include delay and bandwdith performance measurements , MUST include tet-pkt:te-packet under the previous property
The supporting-network property can include the network-id of a base layer-3 network.
The node property should include the list of nodes as described below.
The ietf-network-topology:link MUST be present, with one link per each IP adjacency (one link for each direction of the adjancency).

# YANG Data Model for IS-IS Topology

The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-network" module of {{!RFC8345}}. The ISIS-topology builds on the network data model defined in the "ietf-network" module {{!RFC8345}}, augmenting the nodes with IS-IS information, which anchor the links and are contained in nodes).

There is a set of parameters and augmentations that are included at the node level. Each parameter and description are detailed following:

* Network-types: Its presence identifies the IS-IS topology type. Thus, the network type MUST be isis-topology.
+ IS-IS timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes configured in the network element. They are LSP lifetime and the LSP refresh interval.
- IS-IS status: contains the IS-IS status attributes (level, area-address and neighbours).


There is a second set of parameters and augmentations are included at the termination point level. Each parameter is listed as follows:

* Interface-type
+ Level
+ Metric
- Passive mode

# Security Considerations

  The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS {{!RFC5246}}.

   The NETCONF access control model {{!RFC6536}} provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
